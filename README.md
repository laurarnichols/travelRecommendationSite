# Travel Recommendation Web Application
[_Check out the deployed solution on GitHub pages_](https://laurarnichols.github.io/travelRecommendationSite/)

This project was developed as part of a Coursera class on JavaScript. The goal of the assignment was to create a fully functional travel recommendation web application using only built-in functionality in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspiration images for the Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages were provided as part of the assignment, but all actual implementation, including sourcing and styling images, was completed independently.

## Overview

The Travel Recommendation Web Application allows users to:

- Navigate between the Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages using a navigation bar.
- Search for travel recommendations by keyword (e.g., "beach," "temple," or "Australia").
- View travel recommendations with images and descriptions based on their search.
- Reset the search results.
- View a contact form that would be used to get in touch with the company.
